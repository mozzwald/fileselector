1.3.2  Alex Ferguson  <thoughtmonster@gmail.com>

 * Changed from semicolon-seperated list to comma-seperated list.
 
 * Made font-loading behaviour a bit more tolerant.

1.3.1  Alex Ferguson  <thoughtmonster@gmail.com>

 * Fixed the gray background issue for when the window size does not
   entirely match the row heights.

 * Cleaned up source code, making it more readable and (hopefully)
   efficient.

 * Fixed filter matching to correctly match extensions.

1.3  Alex Ferguson  <thoughtmonster@gmail.com>

 * Fixed a couple of bugs, including the annoying screen flicker
   at startup.

1.2 Alex Ferguson  <thoughtmonster@gmail.com>

 * Added support for command-line options. Options implemented are:
   -d: Start fileselector in selected directory.
   -f: Only show files matching the colon-seperated filter list.

   The filter list is colon-seperated with each string parsed and
   stored in the filter_list array. The array is then recursed over
   in the file_check filter.

 * Added support for toggling the filter by pressing the 'f' key.

 * Made fileselector use the native screen screen dimensions instead
   of the hardcoded 320x240 ones.

 * Made fileselector resizable, with the number of rows adapting
   to the available window height.

 * Modified 'fileselector-bg' to use the native screen dimensions instead
   of the hardcoded 320x240 ones.

 * Some bug fixes and cosmetic fixes.

1.1  Alex Ferguson  <thoughtmonster@gmail.com>

 * Added more key definitions, backspace, page up/down etc.

 * Added support for not showing hidden files and folders and
   toggling their visibility with the 'h' key.

 * Modified fill_fname_array for folders-first by calling scandir
   twice, once with the 'directory_check' filter and once with the
   'file_check' filter, appending their results.

 * Added 'fileselector-bg', which displays a black window usable as a
   simple background for scripts that use fileselector. Amazing, eh?

1.0  Alex Ferguson  <thoughtmonster@gmail.com>

 * Cleaned up code, renamed definitions in Spanish to English.

 * Slight visual overhaul, moved current dir name from the window to
   the window title (which looks cool in Muffinman). Colors changed.

 * Enable key repeating in SDL.
